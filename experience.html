              As an intern, I assisted the Species Distribution Modeling team in working with population prediction and environmental data. 
              <br>
              I performed data cleaning and deployed a machine learning model on a cactus species and was able to generate occurence data for it under bioclimatic variables and climate predictions.
              <br>
              Furthermore, we were tasked with rendering reports for seasonal and marine data, where we generated synthetic data, created project configurations, and debugged domain data from a workflow! In the end, we were able to graph complex spatial and raster data along with range maps.

              <p class="work-summary">
              Foundry Six gave me the opportunity to protype and research a new platform, 8th Wall, which could potentially used in their AR development projects. 
              <br> <br>
              Over the course of 3 months, I extensively prototyped a tower defense style game with 2 levels, different types of weapons, and enemies with varying strengths.
              <br>
              By implementing game development methods like object pooling, the entity component system, and collision detection from scratch, I essentially learned how to build the project from the ground up while receiving amazing feedback from the team!

            <p class="work-summary">I employed a “coaching instead of telling” method to push students through a productive struggle in the process of debugging their code for a better understanding of Python functions, conditionals, loops, and libraries.
            <br>
            Not only did this deepen my understanding of Python overall, I was able to communicate effectively when explaining computer science logic and concepts.</p>
