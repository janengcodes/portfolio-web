            At CONMED Corporation, I worked on the company’s most important 
            project, the next generation AirSeal. This is an air insufflation medical
            device used by surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgery.
          <br>
          <br>
            I worked full-stack and with an embedded Android operating system,
            specifically:
            <br>
            <br>
            ✧ Developed seamless firmware updating through USB with C++ and Java
            <br>
            ✧ Built Android GUI app components with Java and XML
            <br>
            ✧ Created language localization for surgical procedures, surgeon 
            specialties, and error codes
            <br>
            ✧ Developed a Figma prototype for CONMED’s quality team with working navigation and 
            dropdowns for asset management
            <br>
            ✧ Designed error code screens that adhered to international standards
            <br>
            ✧ Set up embedded systems testing with an emulator using C# and XML

          <div id="conmed-description">
            At Yale University, while working for the Jetz Lab at the Yale Center for 
            Biodiversity and Global Change, I picked up skills in data science, 
            the programming language R, and AI/ML.
            <br>
            <br>
            The internship began with deploying smaller ML models 
            for geospatial population prediction using climate models from R libraries.
            <br>
            <br>
            After, I collaborated on generating YAML project configurations and 
            synthetic datasets for a test species. Additionally, I played a major role in debugging an issue in our biodiversity data masking, and I performed data cleaning on climate datasets to render plots with AI-generated occurrences for a species.

          <div id="conmed-description">
            At Foundry Six, I developed a mobile AR mini-game from scratch, which was inspired by tower defense. The game consisted of 2 different levels, a coin-reward system, and multiple characters.
            <br><br>
            During the process, I developed more than 15 JavaScript game components, employed the entity component system, and used object pooling to control game objects. Additionally, I edited 3-D models on Blender, going above expectations. 
            <br><br>
            Because I’m not a gamer myself, this experience taught me a lot about user experience. While I aimed for the game to be technically complex, I also wanted it to be intuitive for first-time players.
